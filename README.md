# Boat Game

Academic project made in C++. Made in collaboration with Manuel Alejandro Esparza Villa.

## Description

In this game, we control a robot which has to transport a fox, a rabbit and a lettuce, using a boat. The boat can only carry two individuals, and the boat can only move if the robot is a passenger, apart from that, we have some constraints:

- If we left the fox and rabbit alone, the rabbit will get eaten by the fox.
- If we left the rabbit and lettuce alone, the lettuce will get eaten by the fox.

The player must control the robot to find a way to transport all the individuals from the left shore to the right shore safely.
